## How to install

You can download the app installer from [Releases](https://github.com/r4ai/tinnitus-reducer-acrn/releases/latest) page. The app is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.  

For linux, because I don't have a linux machine, I can't test the app. If you have any problem, please let me know by opening an issue. Even for other OS, please let me know if you have any problem.

There are no mobile apps yet, but I am planning to make one.
